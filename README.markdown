Vinyl is a general solution to the records problem in Haskell using type level strings and other modern GHC features, featuring static structural typing (with a subtyping relation), and automatic row-polymorphic lenses. All this is possible without Template Haskell.

First, install Vinyl from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl):

    cabal update
    cabal install vinyl
